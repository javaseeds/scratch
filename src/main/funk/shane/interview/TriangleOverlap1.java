 * Given two rectangles, find if the given two rectangles overlap or not.
     Note that a rectangle can be represented by two coordinates, top left and bottom right.
     So mainly we are given following four coordinates.
       l1: Top Left coordinate of first rectangle.
       r1: Bottom Right coordinate of first rectangle.
       l2: Top Left coordinate of second rectangle.
       r2: Bottom Right coordinate of second rectangle.
